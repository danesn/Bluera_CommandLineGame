# Bluera_CommandLineGame

//Bluera |RPG, Adventure (maybe)|//

This is my first game made using C++ programming language. Still many bugs out there.
It is still WIP Project. so in the future i will make save & load game data, improving the game, 
and add some animation effect for each weapon and skill/magic.

I'm sorry because this game is still in Indonesian. maybe in the future I will translate it into English.

//ABOUT THIS GAME//
There is level system (Exp), gold system, and profile character.

Choose your character (Bluera or Leura), and name your character.
Choose your weapon (sword | axe | arrow | magicwand). 

When you have finished choosing your character and the weapon you will be in a town.
"cek status pemain" it means checking ur character status.
"pergi ke hutan"    it means "go to forest for battle with some monster to get exp and gold". 
"beli potion"       it means "buy potion".
"tingkatkan status" it means "enchance ur character status" so here you will train your character to 
                    improve the character's status by paying training for 5,000 gold.

The game will end when:
Your health point (hp/life) has reached 0 and has no money to buy potion (500g for half-life/half-hp or 1000g for fullhp).
